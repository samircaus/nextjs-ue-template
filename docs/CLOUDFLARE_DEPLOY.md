# Deploying to Cloudflare (OpenNext)

This project uses [@opennextjs/cloudflare](https://opennext.js.org/cloudflare) to run Next.js on Cloudflare Workers. The worker entry point (`.open-next/worker.js`) and assets (`.open-next/assets`) are **generated by the OpenNext build** and are not in git.

## Fix: "The entry-point file at '.open-next/worker.js' was not found"

This error means the **deploy** step ran without a prior **OpenNext** build. Only `opennextjs-cloudflare build` creates `.open-next/worker.js`; a plain Next.js build (`next build` / `npm run build`) does not.

### Wrong (what causes the error)

| Step   | Wrong command | Why it fails |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| Build  | `npm run build` or `next build` | Produces `.next/` only; **does not** create `.open-next/worker.js` |
| Deploy | `npx wrangler versions upload` or `npx wrangler deploy` | Looks for `.open-next/worker.js`, which was never created |

### Correct (use these in Cloudflare dashboard)

| Step   | Command |
|--------|--------|
| **Build** | `npx opennextjs-cloudflare build` |
| **Deploy** | `npx opennextjs-cloudflare deploy` |

For gradual deployments use **Deploy:** `npx opennextjs-cloudflare upload` instead of `deploy`.

Or run both locally: `npm run deploy`.

## Cloudflare Workers Builds (Git integration)

In [Workers Builds](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/) → your project → **Settings → Build**:

1. **Build command:** `npx opennextjs-cloudflare build`  
   (not `npm run build` or `next build`)

2. **Deploy command** (production branch, e.g. `main`):  
   `npx opennextjs-cloudflare deploy`  
   (not `npx wrangler deploy`)

3. **Non-production branch deploy command** (other branches):  
   `npx opennextjs-cloudflare upload`  
   **Important:** The default is `npx wrangler versions upload`, which causes the "worker.js was not found" error. You must change this to the OpenNext command so non-main branches also use the OpenNext build output.

4. **Preview-tier branch** (deploy with AEM **Preview** URL instead of Publish):  
   Use the `preview` env so the worker uses `AEM_PREVIEW_URL` for GraphQL and assets. For example, from a branch named `preview`:  
   `npx opennextjs-cloudflare deploy -- --env preview`  
   In Workers Builds you can set a separate **Production branch** for preview (e.g. `preview`) and use the deploy command above, or run this in CI for the preview branch.

### If you still see "worker.js was not found"

- **Building from a branch other than `main`?** Change **Non-production branch deploy command** (see step 3 above). That’s the command that runs for non-production branches; its default is `npx wrangler versions upload`.
- In the build log, confirm the **Build** step shows OpenNext (e.g. "opennextjs-cloudflare build" or ".open-next"). If you see only "next build" / "npm run build", the Build command in the dashboard is still wrong or not saved.

## Environment variables

**`.env` files are not loaded in production on Cloudflare.** They are local only and are not deployed. You must set variables in Cloudflare:

| Use case | Where to set |
|----------|----------------|
| **Build** (Next/OpenNext build, SSG, `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` inlining) | [Workers Builds → Build variables and secrets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/configuration/#build-variables-and-secrets) |
| **Runtime** (Worker at request time) | [Workers → Settings → Variables and Secrets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/environment-variables/) |

Set the same names you use in `.env`: `AEM_PUBLISH_URL`, `AEM_PREVIEW_URL`, `AEM_AUTHOR_URL`, `AEM_PREVIEW_MODE`, `AEM_USE_PREVIEW_URL`, `AEM_UE_CONNECTION`, etc. (see `.env.example` and `wrangler.jsonc`). Use **Secrets** for sensitive values (they cannot be read back from the dashboard). To avoid deployments removing existing vars: `opennextjs-cloudflare deploy -- --keep-vars`. If neither Publish nor Preview URL is set, the app renders fallback text instead of AEM content.

Details: [OpenNext env vars (production)](https://opennext.js.org/cloudflare/howtos/env-vars#production).

## Local deploy

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This runs `opennextjs-cloudflare build` then `opennextjs-cloudflare deploy` (see `package.json`).

## Preview locally (Workers runtime)

```bash
npm run preview
```

Builds and runs the worker locally with `opennextjs-cloudflare preview`.
